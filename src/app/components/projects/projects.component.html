    <h3>Smart Pond Monitoring System</h3>
    <p>
      Manual pond monitoring is inefficient and lacks real-time insights, leading to poor water quality management.
      The <strong>Smart Pond Monitoring System</strong> addresses this by automating sensor-based tracking of water conditions
      through a web application for efficient and timely decision-making.
